arduino-mock[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jdalrymple/arduino-mock.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jdalrymple/arduino-mock)
============

A GMock stub library for a mock of Arduino libraries.

How it works
============

This is the mock library for Arduino sketch program.
To run unittest for this mock, please follow this
instruction.

    $ git clone https://github.com/ikeyasu/arduino-mock.git
    $ cd arduino-mock
    $ git submodule update --init --recursive
    $ cd test
    $ make test
    for t in arduino_unittest serial_unittest spark_unittest; do ./$t; done;
    Running main() from gmock_main.cc
